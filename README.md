# Slither
An attempt to implement a method of verifying the validity of HTTP packets in eBPF as based on the following paper by Dau Anh Dung and Yasuhiro Nakamura: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377321387_Verification_of_State_Based_Slow_HTTP_DDoS_Prevention_Method 

The name is a portmanteau of Slow and Filter, made to sound like slither. 

It is not yet functional, but a full guide will be posted on shahboz.wiki when it is ready.
